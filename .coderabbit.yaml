        # General Coding Standards (Complements Linters/Formatters)
        - Ensure all files use UTF-8 character encoding.
        - Lines should end with LF (line feed).
        - A newline character must be present at the end of every file.
        - Trim all trailing whitespaces.
        - Adhere to a maximum line length of 120 characters.
        - TODO/FIXME comments: Address them or create corresponding issues before merging.
        - Debugging code: Remove `console.log`, `debugger` statements, and other debugging helpers from production-bound code.
        - Code Clarity: Strive for self-documenting code through clear naming (variables, functions, classes) and logical structure.
        - YAGNI: Apply the "You Aren't Gonna Need It" principle. Avoid adding functionality until it's truly necessary.
        - Internationalization (i18n):
          - Externalize all user-facing strings into resource files if internationalization is a goal.
          - Avoid string concatenation for translated segments; use template literals or parameterized strings that respect language structure.
        # Testing Best Practices
        - Test Naming: Use descriptive names for test files (e.g., `*.spec.ts`, `*.test.ts`) and keep them co-located with the source files.
        - Test Cases: Clearly describe what each test (`describe` block) and individual case (`it` block) covers.
        - Granularity: Each test case should ideally verify a single aspect or behavior. Multiple assertions are fine if they test the same logical unit.
        - Independence: Ensure tests are independent and can run in any order without side effects on other tests.
        - DRY Principle in Tests: Avoid duplicating logic in tests, but don't over-abstract to the point of obscurity.
        - Edge Cases: Explicitly test edge cases and boundary conditions.
        - Focus: Test the public API and observable behavior, not internal implementation details (avoid over-mocking).
        - Mocks: Mock external dependencies to isolate tests and ensure reliability.
        - Setup/Teardown: Use `beforeEach`/`afterEach` (or equivalent) for consistent test setup and cleanup.

        # TypeScript Best Practices (Complements Biome Formatter & ESLint)
        # Type System & Safety
        - Explicit Types: Prefer explicit type annotations for variables, function parameters, and return types over implicit `any`.
        - `any` vs `unknown`: Avoid `any` where possible. Use `unknown` for values with truly unknown types and perform type-checking before use.
        - `import type`: Use `import type` for importing types and interfaces to ensure they are erased at compile time.
        - Type Guards: Implement type guards for runtime type checking when dealing with unions or complex types.
        - Reusable Types: Define reusable types/interfaces for common data structures. Use `interface` for object shapes and `type` for aliases, unions, intersections.
        # Naming Conventions
        - PascalCase: For types, interfaces, enums, and class names.
        - camelCase: For variables, function names, and class properties/methods.
        # Functions & Class Design
        - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Functions and classes should have a single, well-defined responsibility.
        - Brevity: Keep functions and methods concise (aim for 10-20 lines as a guideline, decompose larger ones).
        - Parameters: Limit the number of function parameters (3-4 is a good guideline). Pass an object for more complex inputs.
        - Early Exits: Use guard clauses and return early to reduce nesting and improve readability.
        - Side Effects: Minimize side effects. Functions should ideally rely on inputs to produce outputs. Clearly document any necessary side effects.
        - Immutability: Prefer immutable data structures and patterns where practical.
        - Composition over Inheritance: Favor composition for code reuse and flexibility. Avoid deep inheritance hierarchies.
        - Error Handling: Implement robust error handling using try/catch blocks, error returns, or specific error types.
        - Readability: Use descriptive names. Add comments only for complex logic that isn't self-evident from the code.
        - `public` Modifier: While not strictly necessary for JavaScript output, explicitly using `public` (and `private`/`protected`) improves code clarity and intent in TypeScript classes.

        # JavaScript Best Practices (Complements Biome Formatter & ESLint)
        - Modern JavaScript: Use ES6+ features (e.g., `let`/`const`, arrow functions, template literals, destructuring) where appropriate for clarity and conciseness.
        - Strict Mode: Ensure `'use strict';` is enabled or implicitly active (e.g., in ES modules).
        - Readability: Follow similar principles as TypeScript for naming, function design (SRP, brevity, early exits), and error handling.
        - Comments: Use comments to explain non-obvious logic.
        - Avoid global variables where possible.

        # Astro Component Best Practices
        - Component Structure: Ensure components are well-structured. Props should be clearly defined in the frontmatter for data input. Use slots effectively for content projection.
        - Frontmatter (---):
          - Use the `---` code fence for server-side JavaScript/TypeScript logic.
          - Define props using `Astro.props` and provide types for them (e.g., `interface Props { title: string; } const { title } = Astro.props;`).
          - Perform data fetching and other server-side operations here.
        - Client-Side Interactivity:
          - Use `<script>` tags for client-side JavaScript sparingly.
          - Prefer Astro's partial hydration using client directives (`client:load`, `client:idle`, `client:visible`, `client:media`, `client:only="vue"` etc.) to ship minimal JavaScript.
          - Clearly justify the need for any client-side script that isn't using a directive.
        - Styling:
          - Styles in `<style>` tags are scoped by default, leverage this to avoid CSS conflicts.
          - Use `<style is:global>` or CSS Modules deliberately if global styles or more complex CSS organization is needed.
          - Ensure consistency with the AuraFlow™ Lite Design System (if applicable to the component, as mentioned in README).
        - Accessibility (A11y):
          - Write components that produce semantic HTML (e.g., use `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<button>`).
          - Ensure interactive elements are keyboard accessible.
          - Use ARIA attributes appropriately where semantic HTML alone is insufficient.
          - Test for basic screen reader compatibility.
        - Performance:
          - Avoid rendering large amounts of data or complex components unnecessarily.
          - Optimize images and other assets.
          - Leverage Astro's features for static generation and partial hydration.
        - Slots: Use named slots for more complex component APIs and default slot content for flexibility.

      instructions: |
        # Astro Configuration (astro.config.mjs)
        - Adapter: Ensure the `@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter is correctly configured, especially `platformProxy: { enabled: true }` for full Cloudflare compatibility.
        - Integrations: Verify that all necessary Astro integrations are included and properly configured.
        - Server Options: Confirm `server: { port: 1312 }` (or the intended development port) is set as per project standards.
        - Paths: Check `srcDir`, `publicDir`, `outDir` if customized from defaults.
        - TypeScript: Ensure tsconfig path (`tsconfigPath`) is correct if non-standard.
    - path: "wrangler.jsonc"
      instructions: |
        # Wrangler Configuration (wrangler.jsonc)
        - Name: Verify the `name` field matches the intended Cloudflare Worker service name.
        - Entry Point: Ensure `main` correctly points to the worker entry script (e.g., `./dist/_worker.js/index.js` for Astro projects).
        - Compatibility:
          - `compatibility_date` should be recent (current: "2025-05-08") and aligned with tested Cloudflare runtime features.
          - `compatibility_flags` (e.g., `nodejs_compat`) must be included if Node.js APIs are utilized in Workers.
        - Assets: The `assets` binding for static files (e.g., `binding = "ASSETS"`, `directory = "./dist"`) must be correctly configured for Astro builds.
        - Bindings: All necessary Cloudflare service bindings (KV, D1, R2, Queues, Vectorize, AI, Durable Objects, Services as per Tech Stack) must be declared. Ensure binding names are consistent with code usage.
        - Environment Variables & Secrets: Review `vars` for non-sensitive configurations. Sensitive data must use secrets and not be hardcoded.
        - Placement: If using `placement: { mode: "smart" }`, ensure it's intentional and understood.
        - Observability: Ensure `observability: { enabled: true }` is set for better monitoring.
    - path: "**/*.json,**/*.jsonc"
      instructions: |
        # JSON and JSONC Formatting (Complements Biome Formatter)
        - Indentation: Use 2 spaces for indentation.
        - Wrapping: Array and object items should generally be on new lines if the structure is complex or long.
        - Trailing Commas: Strictly avoid trailing commas in plain `.json` files. For `.jsonc`, if Biome is configured to allow them, ensure consistency.
        - Property Alignment: Properties should not be aligned (often handled by formatters).
        - Spacing:
          - Add a space after colons (key-value pairs) and commas (in arrays/objects).
          - Do not add a space before colons or commas.
        - Comments: For JSONC, use comments (// or /* */) appropriately to explain non-obvious parts of the configuration.

        # Markdown Content and Structure (Complements Markdownlint)
        - Clarity: Ensure content is clear, concise, and easy to understand for the intended audience.
        - Structure: Use headings (H1, H2, H3, etc.) logically to structure the document effectively.
        - Formatting: Use Markdown syntax correctly for lists, code blocks, links, images, tables, emphasis, etc.
        - Links: Verify that all internal and external links are working, relevant, and accessible.
        - Code Blocks: Specify the language for syntax highlighting in code blocks (e.g., \`\`\`typescript or \`\`\`sh).
        - Readability: Break up long paragraphs. Use bolding or italics sparingly and meaningfully for emphasis.
        - READMEs: Ensure `README.md` files are comprehensive, covering project overview, goals, tech stack, setup instructions, development process, deployment, and contribution guidelines. Ensure it aligns with the actual project state.
    - path: "**/*.sql"
      instructions: |
        # SQL File Best Practices (especially for Drizzle Migrations)
        - DDL Statements: Verify `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, `DROP TABLE` statements accurately reflect intended schema changes.
        - DML Statements: If `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` statements are present (e.g., for data seeding or migration), ensure they are correct, idempotent if necessary, and performant.
        - Constraints & Indexes: Check that `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `UNIQUE` constraints, and `INDEX` definitions are correct and align with data relationships and query patterns.
        - Migration Logic: For Drizzle (or other ORM) generated migration files, review the sequence of operations. Confirm it's logical and handles data transformations correctly if any.
        - Idempotency & Reversibility: Consider if migrations should be idempotent (safe to run multiple times) or if a down-migration script is needed.
        - Performance: Be mindful of potential performance impacts of schema changes or data migrations on large tables.
        - Generated SQL Review: If generated by a tool like `drizzle-kit`, double-check that the output SQL is as expected and doesn't have unintended consequences.

        # YAML File Best Practices (Complements Yamllint)
        - Indentation: Use exactly 2 spaces per indentation level. Do not use tabs.
        - Quotes:
          - Use quotes for strings consistently. Single or double quotes are acceptable, but maintain consistency within a file.
          - Ensure strings that could be misinterpreted as numbers, booleans, or other types are quoted (e.g., "123", "true", "null").
          - Avoid unnecessary quoting of simple, unambiguous strings.
        - Key Quoting: Only quote keys if they contain special characters (e.g., spaces, colons, dashes at the start) or could be misinterpreted.
        - Comments: Use `#` for comments. Provide clear explanations for configurations, especially for complex structures or non-obvious settings.
        - Readability: Strive for clear and readable YAML. Group related items and use whitespace effectively.
        - Tooling: Utilize tools like `yamllint` to automatically check for syntax errors, stylistic issues, and best practices.
        - Consistency: Ensure that YAML files within the project follow a consistent style.
