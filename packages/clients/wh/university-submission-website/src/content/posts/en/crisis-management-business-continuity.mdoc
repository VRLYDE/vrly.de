The final lectures on 'Risk Response' and 'Improving IROM Systems' brought the entire risk management cycle to a strategic conclusion for me. While the core response strategies are straightforward, such as Avoid, Reduce, and Transfer, the concept of Bear/Tolerate' revealed a deeper level of maturity. It is not passive resignation, but an active, conscious decision based on a cost-benefit analysis, which requires a confident understanding of one's own risk appetite.

This leads directly to the key insight from the final lecture: a mature *IROM system* is not just a defensive necessity, but a proactive driver of sustainable value. The frameworks presented, such as the EFQM Model, clearly show that aspects like 'Driving Performance & Managing Risk' are directly linked to long-term success. The overarching aim is therefore not just to manage a list of risks, but to build a continuously improving, resilient organization that uses its understanding of risk and opportunity to make better strategic decisions and thereby consistently create value.
