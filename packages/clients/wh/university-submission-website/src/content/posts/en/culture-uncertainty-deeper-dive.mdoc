A central and lasting insight from the course came from the discussion on Risk Culture. My initial analysis of standards like ISO 31000 led to a critical observation noted down during the lecture: 'Problem: culture is mentioned nowhere in the ISO-Norms'. This highlighted for me that formal processes are merely the skeleton of an IROM system; its heart and nervous system are the organization's lived culture.
The most significant takeaway was the direct parallel to my professional work in sustainability. A company isn't sustainable just by complying with CSRD; it requires a genuine culture of sustainability. Likewise, an IROM system isn't effective just because a risk handbook exists. It succeeds when a culture of psychological safety encourages open communication about risks and errors. This realization leaves me with a key question for my future practice: How can we effectively and objectively measure risk culture to make it a tangible management asset?
