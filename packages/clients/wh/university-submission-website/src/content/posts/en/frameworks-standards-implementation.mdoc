The discussion in Lectures 5 and 6 prompted a new line of thinking for me. As methods like FMEA were already familiar from my undergraduate studies, my attention was drawn less to the tools themselves and more to a fundamental question raised in the course: Can we, and should we, use the same techniques to manage downside risks as we do to pursue upside opportunities? This led me to consider the inherent asymmetry between them, which I have visualized in the "Asymmetrical Scale" illustration.
