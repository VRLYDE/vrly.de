_This learning journal documents my personal and professional journey through the 'Risk Management' course. My goal is not only to reproduce the content I have learned, but above all to capture the process of gaining insight, my 'aha' moments, and the transformation of my own perspective on the topic of risk and opportunity._

_At the beginning of the course, my understanding of risk management was heavily influenced by a desire for clear rules, structures, and 'perfect' solutions. I saw it as a primarily technical discipline for avoiding errors. This journal traces how this view has fundamentally changedâ€”towards a holistic understanding of risk management as a dynamic, culture-driven, and value-adding process, in which dealing with uncertainty is a core competency._

_Within this journal, I focus on those lecture topics that offered the greatest relevance and the deepest insights for my personal learning process and professional practice. Other important topics from the course are intentionally addressed more briefly or mentioned in the context of broader connections to maintain focus and stay within the scope of this portfolio. This selection reflects my individual path to internalizing the core principles of IROM._

_To document this journey, I use a mixture of written reflections on key topics, a critical engagement with academic literature, as well as creative and practical elements like a video, a podcast excerpt, and conceptual visualizations. It is the story of how theoretical knowledge turned into a professional mindset._
