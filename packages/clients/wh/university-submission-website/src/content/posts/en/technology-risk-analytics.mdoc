Although I was unable to attend the guest lecture on IT security (Lecture 7) due to professional commitments, its core topic “cyber incidents as a primary cause of business interruption” served as a direct lead-in to my reflections on BCM.
My key experience from the course's fire incident simulation, where I witnessed the overwhelming chaos of a crisis, found its structured answer in the BCM session. My core insight was understanding that BCM is the practical bridge between knowing a risk (like a fire or IT outage) and having the concrete ability to remain operational. It provides the necessary toolkit of plans and defined responsibilities to manage chaos effectively. This led me to a crucial practical question: How can an organization ensure that BCM plans are not just 'shelfware,' but a living, tested reality that provides true resilience in a crisis?
