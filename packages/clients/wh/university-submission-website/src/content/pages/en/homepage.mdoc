       text: "This image metaphorically depicts two organizational states. The stable, uniform white stack represents a strong, shared risk culture â€“ the solid foundation upon which effective processes and strategies are built. In contrast, the chaotic, unstable stack illustrates how a weak or inconsistent culture creates inherent fragility, making any system built upon it vulnerable. This visualization reflects my key learning: a sound risk culture is the non-negotiable prerequisite for a resilient and successful IROM system, a topic I found particularly fascinating due to its parallels with establishing a true sustainability culture.",

       alt: "A red and a blue brick",
       text: "Inspired by the fire incident simulation in our course, this minimalist illustration uses two bricks to represent a core dynamic. The single red brick symbolizes the crisis event itself: the sudden alarm, the problem, the 'heat' of the moment. The blue brick represents the ideal response: a calm, structured, and controlled action designed to 'cool' the situation. This captures my realization that while we cannot always prevent a crisis, a mature risk management system prepares us to counter the 'red' of chaos with the 'blue' of a deliberate and effective response.",

       text: "This image visualizes my learning that risk management is not a linear project with a defined endpoint, but a continuous, cyclical process. The circle represents the IROM framework, and the (cropped-out) minifigure about to place the 'final' brick symbolizes the ongoing effort required for monitoring, reviewing, and improving the system. It illustrates that the process is never truly 'done,' reflecting the principle of continuous improvement that I initially found challenging to accept due to its demanding nature.",
