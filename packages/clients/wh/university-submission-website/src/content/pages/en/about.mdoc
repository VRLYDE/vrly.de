{% About title="About Wanja" subtitle="Welcome to my personal journey of discovery in the fascinating world of risk management. What started as a required course became a transformative learning experience that changed my entire perspective on uncertainty, strategy, and resilience." content="<br/><br/><span class=\"text-neutral-400\">My journey began with skepticism - risk management seemed like just another academic requirement. But through deep engagement with concepts of antifragility, stakeholder management, and organizational culture, I discovered a field that bridges theory and practice in remarkable ways. This blog chronicles my evolution from viewing risk as purely negative to understanding it as 'the effect of uncertainty on objectives' - a perspective that has profound implications for how we navigate complexity in our personal and professional lives.<br/><br/>Here, I share my insights, reflections, and discoveries as I explore frameworks, challenge conventional thinking, and learn to embrace uncertainty as a source of growth and opportunity. Join me as I continue to learn, question, and grow in this ever-evolving field.</span>" /%}
