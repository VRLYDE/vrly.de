# Project Overview: University Submission Website

## 1. Objective

To rapidly develop and deploy a static one-page website to meet an urgent university assignment deadline for the client. The primary success metric is on-time delivery.

## 2. Scope & Deliverables

A single, static HTML/CSS page with a blog-like aesthetic, containing the following pre-defined sections:

Header Section: Welcome text and two static image visualizations (mind map, before/after chart).
Content Section 1: Multiple, distinctly styled text-only blocks.

Content Section 2: Three modules with an alternating image/text layout.

Multimedia Section:

Self-hosted video file (.mov provided).

Self-hosted audio/podcast file.

Footer Section: Text for a disclaimer and a bibliography.

## 3. Timeline & Deadline

Start Date: June 15, 2025

CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT DEADLINE: June 15, 2025 @ 23:59

## 4. Technical Decisions

Build: Static site. No CMS or backend required to ensure rapid development.

Video/Audio: Files will be self-hosted to avoid GDPR/cookie banner requirements associated with third-party embeds (e.g., YouTube), simplifying the build.

## 5. Risks & Mitigation

Primary Risk: Delay in receiving content from the client, making the deadline unachievable.

Mitigation Strategy: A structured, non-technical Project Requirements Questionnaire has been created and sent to the client. This will streamline asset collection and ensure all necessary content is provided in a single, organized handoff, minimizing back-and-forth communication.
